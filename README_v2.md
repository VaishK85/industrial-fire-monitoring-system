An IoT-based system for real-time detection and remote monitoring of hazardous gases and smoke in industrial environments using the MQ-2 Gas Sensor and NodeMCU ESP8266, integrated with the ThingSpeak cloud platform.

->Project Overview:
In industrial settings, gas leaks and smoke accumulation are major causes of fire hazards. This project presents a scalable and low-cost solution that continuously monitors air quality and alerts users to abnormal conditions.

->Hardware Components:
1. MQ-2 Gas Sensor (for LPG, Methane, CO, and smoke detection)
2. NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module
3. Breadboard and Jumper Wires
4. Micro USB Cable
5. Power Supply (5V)

->IoT Platform:
ThingSpeak Cloud Server-
a. Displays real-time gas concentration in percentage
b. Enables remote monitoring via live dashboard
c. Supports data logging for future analysis

->Features:
1. Real-time monitoring of gas and smoke levels
2. Wi-Fi-based data transmission using ESP8266
3. Live dashboard visualization through ThingSpeak
4. Easy deployment and cost-effective hardware
5. Scalable solution for various industrial settings
